# Absolutely inefficient project to generate a moving wallpaper

- Do not use
- If you use it, do not complain.
- It's slow. I know.
- It does not use the resources built-in, but uses the SVGs available in the official repository
- This was done in maybe 20 minutes, so don't expect any optimization
